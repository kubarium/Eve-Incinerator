#Eve Incinerator

Eve Incinerator is a tool I developed for an MMORPG, Eve Online. I often play a character that's invested in industrial operations so I needed to know what blueprints I should seek to use up the ingredients I come across or buy.

As you can see from the screenshot below, you first search for and add your ingredients/materials to a list then you can pull a list of blueprints that require the items in that list. It's a great way to see available blueprints when you have excess amount of certain items that you want to use up.
